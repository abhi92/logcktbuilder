Description:
This is a simple logic circuit builder/simulator. It allows the user to build logic circuits by dragging and dropping various circuit elements(Gates, outputs and inputs).
This was implemented in JAVA using the Swing GUI Toolkit.
The operation of the software is fairly intuitive. More descriptive documentation is provided in simulator.pdf, which is the project report for this project.
To run the software, 
java --jar logcktbuilder.jar
